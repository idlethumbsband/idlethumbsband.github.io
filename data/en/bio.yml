  title: Who are we?
  content: |
    Idle Thumbs are a garage rock band based in Utrecht.
    Our songs are high energy, sabre rattling about topics like nuclear war, gentrification and toasters, of course.
    We formed in the middle of the pandemic.
    The band members have been active in the Netherlands with other groups like the ‘Amazing Epics’, ‘Awkward Silence’ & ‘the Mieters’.
